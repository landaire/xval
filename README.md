xval
====

Xbox 360 xval decryption package. This is mainly a port of [Redline99's Python code](https://gist.github.com/landaire/2669789) for decrypting the X value which he originally posted on Xbox Hacker. Since Xbox Hacker is now down, my various mirrors of it are all that exist.

This utility can be used to see if an Xbox is banned or has other security violations flagged on it.
